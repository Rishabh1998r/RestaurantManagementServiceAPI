## Data Flow

The data flow in this project follows the typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with the following components:

Controller: Handles incoming requests, performs data validation, and calls the appropriate service methods.

Service: Contains the business logic, performs necessary transformations, and interacts with the repository for data persistence.

Repository: Provides an interface for database operations and utilizes Spring Data JPA to perform CRUD operations on the entities.

Database: Stores the data in a relational database.

The flow of data in the application follows these steps:

1- The client sends a request to a specific endpoint in the RESTful API.

2- The controller receives the request, validates the inputs, and delegates to the appropriate service method.

3- The service method performs the necessary business logic, such as creating or retrieving data from the repository.

4- The repository interacts with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

5- The database stores and manages the application data.

6- The response is generated by the service method, returned to the controller, and sent back to the client.

## Project Summary

The Restaurant Management System is a web application built using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and MySQL. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing food items, user accounts, and orders in a restaurant. The application supports user registration, authentication, and authorization, allowing different levels of access based on user roles. Users can view food items, place orders, and track their order status. Admin users have additional privileges, such as managing user accounts and food items. The application follows a RESTful API design, ensuring clear communication between the client and server.
